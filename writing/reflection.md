# Lab 4 Reflection

## Summary

Write a brief summary of what you accomplished in this lab assignment. 

*Use markdown lists (using -) to organize your thoughts throughout this reflection.*

## Lists and Organization

Describe how you organized your code using lists. Use markdown lists to structure your responses:

- **LED lists:** What lists did you create to organize your LED objects and properties?
- **Data lists:** How did you use lists to store options like speeds, brightness levels, and names?
- **List iteration:** How did you use for loops to iterate through your lists?

## List Operations

Describe the different list operations you used. Format your responses using markdown lists:

- **List creation:** How did you create lists with different types of data?
- **List indexing:** Give examples of how you accessed list elements using indices
- **List slicing:** How did you use list slicing (like `[::-1]`) in your patterns?
- **List methods:** What built-in functions like `len()`, `range()`, and `join()` did you use with lists?

## Creative Choices

Describe any creative choices you made in your light show using markdown lists:

- **LED colors:** What colors did you use and how did you organize them in lists?
- **Custom pattern:** How did you use lists to create unique lighting pattern for the finale?

## Challenges

Describe the main challenges you faced and how you solved them using markdown lists.

## Learning

What are the most important things you learned from this assignment about lists, iteration, and data organization?

## Improvements

If you were to complete this assignment again, what would you do differently to improve your use of lists or create more interesting patterns?
